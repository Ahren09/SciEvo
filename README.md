## Key Features
- **Longitudinal Coverage:** Includes academic publications from arXiv since **1991**.
- **Rich Metadata:** Titles, abstracts, full texts, keywords, subject categories, and citation relationships.
- **Comprehensive Citation Graphs:** Captures citation networks to analyze influence and knowledge diffusion.
- **Interdisciplinary Focus:** Supports cross-disciplinary studies on research evolution and knowledge exchange.
- **Analytical and Visualization Tools:** Provides tools for analyzing terminology shifts, citation dynamics, and paradigm shifts.
- **Ease of usage**: Instead of downloading from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), which can be costly and requires API keys, you can directly download the dataset from HuggingFace.

## Research Applications
SciEvo enables researchers to explore **scientific knowledge evolution** and **citation patterns** with a broad range of applications:
- **Terminology Evolution:** Tracking the rise and decline of key terms over time.
- **Citation Dynamics:** Understanding citation lifespan and field-specific differences.
- **Interdisciplinary Research Patterns:** Analyzing how different disciplines interact.
- **Scientific Paradigm Shifts:** Identifying major shifts in research focus.
- **Comparative Field Analysis:** Exploring differences in knowledge production and citation behavior across disciplines.

## Example Findings
Using SciEvo, we uncover key insights into the evolution of scientific research:
- **Paradigm Shifts:** Scientific progress occurs in leaps rather than through gradual accumulation. Applied fields, such as LLM research, show rapid shifts.
- **Keyword Trends:** Machine learning terms surged post-2015, reflecting the growing dominance of AI-related research.
- **Citation Lifespan:** Applied fields exhibit shorter citation cycles (e.g., **LLM research: 2.48 years**, **Oral History: 9.71 years**), indicating recency bias in some disciplines.
- **Disciplinary Homophily:** Over **91% of citations occur within the same discipline**, showing strong field-specific citation preferences.
- **Epistemic Cultures:** Applied research relies on recent works, whereas theoretical fields prioritize foundational literature.
