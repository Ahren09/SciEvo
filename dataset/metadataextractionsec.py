# Extracting Metadata for Better Document Indexing and Understanding

In many cases, especially with long documents, a chunk of text may lack the context necessary to disambiguate the chunk from other similar chunks of text. One method of addressing this is manually labelling each chunk in our dataset or knowledge base. However, this can be labour intensive and time consuming for a large number or continually updated set of documents.

To combat this, we use LLMs to extract certain contextual information relevant to the document to better help the retrieval and language models disambiguate similar-looking passages.

We do this through our brand-new `Metadata Extractor` modules.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

"""**RESULT**: As we can see, the LLM answers the questions correctly.

### Challenges Identified in the Problem Domain

In this example, we observed that the search quality as provided by vector embeddings was rather poor. This was likely due to highly dense financial documents that were likely not representative of the training set for the model.

In order to improve the search quality, other methods of neural search that employ more keyword-based approaches may help, such as ColBERTv2/PLAID. In particular, this would help in matching on particular keywords to identify high-relevance chunks.

Other valid steps may include utilizing models that are fine-tuned on financial datasets such as Bloomberg GPT.

Finally, we can help to further enrich the metadata by providing more contextual information regarding the surrounding context that the chunk is located in.

### Improvements to this Example
Generally, this example can be improved further with more rigorous evaluation of both the metadata extraction accuracy, and the accuracy and recall of the QnA pipeline. Further, incorporating a larger set of documents as well as the full length documents, which may provide more confounding passages that are difficult to disambiguate, could further stresss test the system we have built and suggest further improvements.
